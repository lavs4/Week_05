========================================================================  
Topics Covered

01_CSVDataHandling

    Reading and writing CSV files.
    Parsing CSV data into objects.
    Handling headers and custom delimiters.

02_JSONDataHandling

    JSON parsing with Jackson or Gson.
    Serialization/deserialization of Java objects.
    Handling nested JSON structures.

03_Annotations

    Built-in annotations (@Override, @Deprecated).
    Custom annotation creation and processing.
    Runtime retention policies.

04_Reflections

    Inspecting classes, methods, and fields at runtime.
    Dynamic object instantiation.
    Use cases in frameworks like Spring.

05_ScenarioBasedProblem

    Practical exercises combining I/O, annotations, and reflection.
========================================================================   

Prerequisites

    Java JDK 8+ installed.
    Familiarity with Java I/O streams (Week 4).
    Basic understanding of data formats (CSV/JSON).
